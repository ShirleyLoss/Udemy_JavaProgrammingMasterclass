/* Data types are keyword in Java
 * To define a variable we need to specify the data type, then give our variable a name, and optionally add an expression to initialize. the variable with a value.
 * Declaration Statement: Used to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name, and optionally to set the variable to a certain value.
 *    Eg. int myFirstNumber = 5;
 * Expression: A construct that evaluates to a single value - more on this later.
