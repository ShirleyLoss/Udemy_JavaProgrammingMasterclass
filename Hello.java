/* Java keywords: have a specific meaning and are case sensitive. Eg. public, Public and PUBLIC are different things.
 * public is Java keyword. It is an access modifier. 
 *    An access modifier allows us to define the scope or how other parts of your code or even some else's code can access this code - more on that later.
 * class is Java keyword. Used to define a class with the name following the keyword - Hello(in this case) and left and right curly braces to define the class block.
 * static is Java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts.
 *    for now, know that we need to hace static for java to find our method to run the code we are going to add.
 * void is Java keyword. Used to indicate that the method will not return anything - more on that later.

/* Left and right parenthesis in a method declaration are mandatory and can optionally include one or more parameters
